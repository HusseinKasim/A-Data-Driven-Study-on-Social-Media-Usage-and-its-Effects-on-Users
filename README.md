Social Media has become a shadow of what it once set out to achieve, and has contributed heavily towards degrading users' cognitive abilities and productivity, as well as promoting stress, lack of quality sleep, and mental health problems in people all around the world. This project is a study, performed on a publicly available dataset (found on Kaggle), that attempts to understand how social media usage is affecting users. The goal is to analyze the data provided by this dataset and to attempt to create a machine learning model capable of predicting user behaviors based on their social media usages.
I will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset and attempt to understand a few vital points, which include:

1. Understanding how social media usage and burnout are related.
2. Understanding how social media usage and changes in stress levels are related.
3. Understanding how social media usage and changes in productivity are related.
4. Understanding how social media usage before bed affects sleep quality.
5. Understanding which age groups are more prone to the effects of social media.
6. Understanding which gender is more prone to the effects of social media.
7. Understanding which social media platforms impact users the most.

After which, based on the insights from the analysis, I will determine which points are relevant to the creation of a machine learning model that predicts user outcomes and behaviors associated with social media usage.
